This is my first post and it's gonna be short, just to inaugurate the blog. This blog is more like a notebook, a personal (but public xD) study and record place. I'm studyin coding and design for one year now and I'm finally starting to get the hang of it, so I've decided to make this blog - and hope I can look back a few years from now and see that I've learned a lot. 

Currently I'm working in a company named Pegcar as junior web developer using ruby (but not rails) and learning many frameworks at the same time, so for now I'm jut gonna write down everything I (think I) understand. The point of doing this is not just that it helps me solidify my knoledge but also because I suffer too much reading tutorials on the internet made by people who know too much but don't remember the time he or she was a newby and don't remember what are the non-obvious stuff for a beginner. So I thought no one better than a beginner to understand the problems of a beginner, rigth?

About the site layout, I'm gonna change it soon, but for now I'm using the standard layout that comes when you start a new jekyll blog (jekyll is one of the new stuff I'm learging and it's really awesome!)

Oh, one more thing: I'm a brazillian guy (who hates the carnival!!) and I am not a incredible good english writer, so if you find some errors and want to send me an e-mail so I can learn better and correct, be my guest! ;)

See ya o/
